We are honored to have received the Influential Paper Award at [#ASPLOS23](https://asplos-conference.org/2023) for ["Clearing the Clouds: A Study of Emerging Scale-Out Workloads on Modern Hardware"](https://doi.org/10.1145/2150976.2150982), which was a best paper at ASPLOS'12. 
This was the beginning of our quest to understand the design of cloud-native CPUs and the first generation of server-grade CPUs with ARM cores leading to Cavium ThunderX.
